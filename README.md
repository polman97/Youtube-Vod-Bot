**Youtube Vod Bot**

This is an incomplete project I started a while ago for fun. it automatically creates videos (or shorts) meant to be uploaded to YouTube / TikTok. 
I do NOT condone the actual use of this app - I was starting to learn python and heard about people using similar programs to automate content for content farms, and I wondered if I would be able to create something similar.

This app does various things - it has several moviepy modules that construct the actual videos, there's a reddit bot that can be used to download videos posted to certain subreddits (filtered based on the most popular posts in the last 24h), 
the reddit bot can also take comments from more "text" based subreddits (such as askreddit). there is also a module that generates subtitles for text, and a module that uses text to speech to generate voiceovers. to give an idea of the possibilities:

- download the most popular videos of the day from a collection of "meme" subreddits and stitch them togheter to create a meme video compilation of the chosen lenght
- find a popular post on r/AskReddit, create a short format video (for youtube shorts or TikTok) - using as background visuals a cutout of a satisfying video or something similar, and text to speech (with subtitles) the question and one of the top answers

the project is in a very incompleted stage, and it's quite messy - I moved on to ther projects and this was quite early in my python journey, but it's somewhat functional.
